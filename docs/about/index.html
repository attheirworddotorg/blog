<p>Iâ€™m Noah, a security engineer at Amazon living in Chicago.
I love all things security, spent over five years doing Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) consulting,
and am now running cross-company security initiatives at Amazon.</p>
<p>I also love observing and discussing how humans organize, communicate, and make decisions.
Those interests led me to major in Policy Analysis (and technically Management but not really), and conduct neuroscience-based
decision making research, in college, and spark my continued interest in geopolitics among other topics.</p>
<h1 id="what-this-blog-is-and-isn-t">What This Blog Is (And Isnâ€™t)<a class="anchor-link" href="#what-this-blog-is-and-isn-t" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-this-blog-is-and-isn-t">

<p>Iâ€™m a deeply private person (ask anyone that knows me well), and the thought of posting my thoughts online is viscerally disturbing.
Amazonâ€™s writing culture has taught me though that, whether I like it or not, writing my thoughts down is a useful mechanism
for developing better-constructed opinions.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve also observed that finding people with opposing views willing to engage in earnest debate has been difficult for me.
My intention is for posts on this blog to serve as a forum to develop and express my views about current events and related topics,
and is an open invitation for others to tell me where Iâ€™m wrong.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t care about political affiliations, will not attempt to convince anyone to change their own, and expect the same in return.
This is not an invitation to be a dick to me (although if you feel the need have at it) or other readers for the lolz or Internet clout.
Save that nonsense for social media.
This is not a technical blog, though I may post about relevant technical topics from time to time.</p>

<li><strong>Take Them At Their Word</strong> (you know, the name of this blog).
Words matter.
I strongly believe in taking people at their word, and good leaders take care to mean what they say.
Humans can say the wrong thing, and thatâ€™s okay, but good leaders own and correct those mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Cite Your Source</strong>.
All quotes, statements of fact, timelines, etc will be backed by first (preferred) and secondhand sources with citations.
I will use a wide variety of sources and best judgement on source quality and trustworthiness.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t Be Boring</strong>.
Geopolitics shmolitics.
My goal is to avoid making this blog an absolute snoozefest.
Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž.</li>

<p>Social links available on the side or menu if youâ€™re on mobile.
Note that I do not use Twitter but do have a Bluesky account.
To engage with a post I encourage using the integrated comment functionality, but that does require a GitHub account
(you can sign up <a href="https://github.com/signup">here</a>).
If thatâ€™s not for you, or you have a vendetta against Microsoft, feel free to send a message or post on Bluesky or LinkedIn
(also owned by Microsoft, sorry).</p>
